Emux <http://emux.googlecode.com>

These are the release notes for Emux and tell you what this project is about,
how to build it, how to install it, and how to run it.

WHAT IS EMUX?

  Emux is a cross-platform emulator project with a goal of emulating multiple
  kinds of machines related to gaming, such as consoles or arcades. Its
  philosophy is very much inspired by the Linux kernel (hence the name), which
  brilliantly manages to support multiple machines while keeping drivers
  entirely platform-independent. Emux is designed in the same way, keeping a
  code base of CPUs and controllers separate from machines.

  It is distributed under the GNU General Public License v2 - see the
  accompanying COPYING file for more details.

SOFTWARE DEPENDENCIES

  Before being able to build Emux, kconfig-frontends needs to be installed on
  your host machine. Linux developers should be very familiar with menuconfig,
  a convenient menu-driven user interface allowing the configuration of the
  Linux kernel. kconfig-frontends brings the ability to use these same tools for
  any project other than the Linux kernel, by packaging these tools apart from
  the kernel so that they can ship independently. However, the project aims at
  tracking changes made to kconfig in the kernel development tree, to ensure
  they benefit to anyone using kconfig-frontends. The current package maintainer
  is Yann E. Morin, and the project is hosted at:
  http://ymorin.is-a-geek.org/projects/kconfig-frontends

  Once kconfig-frontends is built and installed, make sure kconfig-mconf is
  available on your system, as Emux uses this particular frontend.

  Emux can use different audio and video/input frontends. At the time of
  writing, SDL and libcaca are supported for video/input and only SDL for audio.
  During the configuration step, you may select the frontends to be included
  in the build. The configure script will complain if these libraries are not
  found.

  Emux now uses libroxml - a tiny XML parsing library - in order to read input
  configuration files. This library is typically not part of standard
  distributions and needs to be downloaded, built, and installed on your host
  machine. The libroxml project is developed by Tristan Lelong and can be found
  at the following location:
  http://www.libroxml.net/

  Here are the software dependencies for a full-featured build of Emux:
  - autoconf
  - automake
  - kconfig-frontends (with mconf support)
  - libcaca-dev
  - libroxml
  - libsdl1.2-dev
  - pkg-config

CONFIGURING EMUX

  Once all the software dependencies are taken care of, navigate to the emux
  sources folder from a terminal and execute the following command to configure
  Emux:
    ./configure

  This should bring up a menuconfig interface where you can specify frontends,
  machines, CPUs, and controllers to build. If you need help with one particular
  item, press 'h' to show a basic description of your selection.

  Note: standard rules apply if you need to cross-compile Emux.

BUILDING EMUX

  After completion of the configuration step, building is as easy as executing
  the following command:
    make

  As the standard GNU make utility is used, you may append the -j<n> option
  to speed up the build process, where n is your number of execution units.
  Example:
    make -j16

INSTALLING EMUX

  If nothing went wrong during the build process, Emux can be installed on your
  system by executing the following command:
    make install

RUNNING EMUX

  Once installed on your system, you should now be able to run Emux. Here is a
  list of the available options:
    --machine=MACH    Selects machine to emulate
    --audio=AUDIO     Selects audio frontend
    --video=VIDEO     Selects video frontend
    --width=WIDTH     Overrides window width
    --height=HEIGHT   Overrides window height
    --help            Displays help, available frontends and machines

  If you would like to run INVADERS (CHIP-8) using libcaca for graphics, SDL for
  audio, and use the default window size, the command would be:
    emux --machine=chip8 --video=caca --audio=sdl --rom=INVADERS

  Every machine has its subset of options which can be displayed by executing
  emux --machine=MACH where MACH is the machine name. Example:
    emux --machine=nes
